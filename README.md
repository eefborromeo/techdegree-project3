This is my submission for Project 3: Online Registration Form. I received an Exceeds Expectations grade for this project.

In this project, I built a responsive, mobile-friendly registration form using a wide variety of HTML form input types and attributes. Using the supplied mockup files, I built a mobile and desktop version of the form using media queries, and a "mobile-first" approach.
